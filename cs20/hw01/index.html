            I grew up in Morgan Hill, California, west coast best coast. Although I love California, 
            I also really enjoy being out on the east coast because the snow is just amazing!

            I had both my arms broken at the same time when I was in 1st grade, the story behind why is very silly:
            for one of them I tripped while carrying apples back from a garden, and the other I was playing tag 6 weeks
            later <em>(1 week before I got the cast off the first arm)</em>, and I ran into a cement retaining wall... <strong>SILLY</strong>

            Its hard to say my faroite place, but I would say one of my favorite places is with the people I love in CA, I sadly
            dont have any good pictures of me and a group of people all from home in CA. So, here is a picture of another of my
            favorite places, Disney!!
