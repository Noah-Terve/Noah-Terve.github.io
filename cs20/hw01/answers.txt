Here are the urls to my pages:
cpanel: https://noaht.sgedu.site/hw01/
github: https://noah-terve.github.io/cs20/hw01/

1. Name one advantage to using github and one advantage to using the cpanel hosting.

    An andvantage of github is that it is very easy to set up, and uses the same interface
    we are used to seeing as computer science people (namely git). An advantage to cpanel is
    that for it to have a website available to everyone you don't need to show them the source
    code (in git you have to have a public repo).

2. Which of the two types of hosting do you prefer and why?

    I prefer git just because I am very used to using git and it's intricies.

3. What was the most satisfying part of this assignment?

    When I realized that hosting through git was something I could really take charge of, and
    then I went and made a whole series of pages to effectively help myself and anyone else who
    is interested navigate through my github pages site. So, setting up hyperlinks.
